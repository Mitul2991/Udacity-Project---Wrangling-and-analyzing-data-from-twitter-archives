# Project - Wrangling and analyzing data from twitter archives
Part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree

## Project Overview
Gathered data from the archives of a twitter account called WeRateDogs which rates owned dogs in their tweets and adds a humorous comment with it. Gathered retweet and like counts for all the tweets from the twitter API using the access library tweepy and read them into a pandas dataframe in the Jupyter Notebook. Downloaded a tsv file about the tweets programmatically using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries in python. Assessed quality and tidiness issues in the the gathered datasets and cleaned all of them using pandas functions. Analysed the cleaned tables and created visualizations using the matplotlib library.

## What would you need to install?
To work on the project, you will need to install either Python 3 or Anaconda.
